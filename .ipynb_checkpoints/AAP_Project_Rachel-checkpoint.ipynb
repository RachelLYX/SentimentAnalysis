    "##### Explanation of the code below\n",
    "This code uses the Pandas library (implied by the use of df, str.split(), and .mean()) to analyze the word count of review descriptions in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:\n",
    "1. Calculate Word Counts\n",
    "temp_word_count = df['reviewDescription'].str.split().str.len()\n",
    "\n",
    "- df['reviewDescription']: Selects the Pandas Series (a single column) from the DataFrame df that contains the text of the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "- str.split(): This is a powerful Pandas string method. When called without arguments, it splits each string in the Series by whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines). This converts each review string into a list of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example: \"This printer is the best\" becomes ['This', 'printer', 'is', 'the', 'best']\n",
    "    \n",
    "- .str.len(): After the split operation, the resultis a Series of lists. The .str.len() method is then applied to this Series of lists. For a list, len() returns the number of elements in that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Result: The variable temp_word_count is a new Pandas Series. Each value in this Series is an integer representing the total number of words in the corresponding review from the df['reviewDescription'] column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prepare and Display a Temporary DataFrame\n",
    "temp_df_display = df[['reviewDescription']].copy()\n",
    "temp_df_display['word_count'] = temp_word_count\n",
    "print(temp_df_display.head(5))\n",
    "\n",
    "- temp_df_display = df[['reviewDescription']].copy():\n",
    "    - df[['reviewDescription']]: Selects only the reviewDescription column from the original DataFrame df. Using double brackets [[]] ensures the result is a new DataFrame (not a Series).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - .copy(): Creates a deep copy of this small DataFrame. This is a good practice  to ensure that any changes made to temp_df_display (like adding a new column) do not accidentally affect the original DataFrame df and helps avoid a common Pandas warning called SettingWithCopyWarning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- temp_df_display['word_count'] = temp_word_count: Adds the newly calculated word counts as a new column named word_count to the temp_df_display DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- print(temp_df_display.head(5)): Prints the first 5 rows of the temporary DataFrame, showing the original review text alongside its calculated word count. This is for inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate and Print Summary Statistics\n",
    "average_words = temp_word_count.mean()\n",
    "print(f\"\\nAverage words per review: {average_words:.2f}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "total_words = temp_word_count.sum()\n",
    "print(f\"Total words across all reviews: {total_words}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- average_words = temp_word_count.mean(): Calculates the arithmetic mean (average) of all the word counts stored in the temp_word_count Series.\n",
    "- print(f\"\\nAverage words per review: {average_words:.2f}\"): Prints the calculated average word count, formatted to two decimal places.\n",
    "- total_word = temp_word_count.sum(): Calculates the sum of all the word counts, giving the grand total of all words across every single review in the dataset.\n",
    "- print(f\"Total words across all reviews: {total_words}\"): Prints the calculated total word count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of What the Code Does\n",
    "The code snippet performs an analysis to determine the length (in words) of each review description. It then uses these counts to calculate two key metrics for the entire dataset: the average number of words per review and the total number of words written across all reviews."
